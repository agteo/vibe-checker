Build a web app that safely orchestrates automated security tests (DAST/SCA/secret scans/static checks) against explicitly authorized targets and produces actionable, auditable reports mapped to OWASP Top 10 and common standards.

Core Principles / Guardrails (must implement)

Legal & Ethical Only: Before any scan, require (a) target ownership attestation, (b) scope definition (domains, repos, IP ranges), and (c) explicit acceptance of Terms of Use. If not satisfied → block run.

Least Disruptive Testing: Default to Safe Mode (read-only, rate-limited, no destructive payloads). Allow “Aggressive Mode” only for Admins and only after a second confirmation.

Data Minimization: Collect and store only findings metadata + minimal evidence. Mask secrets/PII in logs.

Auditability: Immutable audit log of who ran what, when, and against which scope, with config hashes.

RBAC: Admin, Security Engineer, Developer, Auditor (read-only).

Multi-tenant: Data partition by Organization ID.

No exploit guidance: Reports describe risk and remediation at a high level; no step-by-step exploitation.

Roles

Admin: Manage org, integrations, global policies, approve aggressive scans.

Security Engineer: Create policies, run scans, tune rules, manage findings.

Developer: View findings for owned services, request rescans, upload fixes.

Auditor: Read-only access to reports, export evidence.

Primary Use Cases

On-Demand Scan: A Security Engineer selects a Target App and runs a Safe Mode scan. Results appear in a Findings Dashboard.

CI/CD Gate: A PR triggers a quick scan; results annotate the PR and optionally fail the pipeline when severity thresholds are exceeded.

Scheduled Hygiene: Nightly/weekly scans of production endpoints and main branches.

Third-Party Review: Upload a vendor’s attestation letter; run limited scans against their public app within allowed scope.

High-Level Architecture (no-code friendly)

Frontend: App pages defined below.

Backend: Orchestration workflows (no-code flows) + Webhook listener.

Connectors (HTTP/REST) to external scanners (choose any subset you can call via API):

DAST: OWASP ZAP API (passive + active with throttling), Burp Enterprise API (if available).

SCA/Dependency: GitHub Dependabot alerts API / OSS Index / Snyk API / OSV.dev.

Static linters: Semgrep CI API / CodeQL SARIF upload reader.

Secrets: Gitleaks JSON output ingestion.

Infra posture (optional): CIS benchmarks via external CSPM API.

Storage: Targets, Policies, Scan Jobs, Findings, Evidence (blobs), Audit Logs.

Queue: Simple job queue (app’s background tasks) to run multiple scans with concurrency limits.

Pages & Components
1) Dashboard

Tiles: “Open Critical Findings”, “Avg Time to Fix”, “Last Scan Status”, “Targets Needing Review”.

Chart: Findings over time by severity.

Button: “New Scan”.

2) Targets

Table of TargetApps with filters (type, tags, risk tier).

“Add Target” modal: identifiers, owners, risk tier.

Row actions: View, Run Scan, Policies, Delete (admin only).

3) Policies

Create/Edit ScanPolicy with:

Mode toggle (Safe/Aggressive with warning modal).

Rate limit (req/min), spider depth, include/exclude paths.

Tool selection checklist.

Thresholds (fail pipeline if ≥ High).

Schedule (cron expression with timezone).

AuthProfile picker.

4) Run Scan (Wizard)

Step 1: Select TargetApp.

Step 2: Select Policy (default Safe Mode).

Step 3: Confirm Scope (previews base URLs/IP ranges, includes/excludes).

Step 4: Consent Checkboxes (ownership attestation, terms acceptance).

Step 5: Optional Admin Approval (if Aggressive Mode).

Step 6: Launch. Show live log viewer (streamed, redacted).

5) Findings

Faceted search: severity, tool, OWASP tag, CWE, status, owner.

Row opens drawer with: summary, reproducibility notes (generic), evidence preview (redacted), affected assets, remediation guidance (best-practice, non-exploit), “Create Ticket”, “Mark False Positive”, “Accept Risk (with justification)”, “Verify Fix/Rescan”.

6) Reports

Select time range and targets; generate:

Executive Summary (KPIs, trend charts).

Technical Appendix (by tool, by category).

Standards Mapping: OWASP Top 10, NIST 800-53/ISO 27001 (high-level mapping), ASVS L1-L3 coverage.

Export: PDF/CSV/JSON; Signed report hash & timestamp.

7) Integrations

Connect GitHub/GitLab: set repo mapping → target(s).

Webhook endpoints page (auto-generated URLs) for CI triggers, with HMAC secret.

Ticketing: Jira/Linear/Asana connectors (create/update tickets).

Notifications: Email/Slack/MS Teams with severity filters.

8) Admin → Audit & Settings

View immutable AuditLog with filters.

Org settings: data retention days, PII redaction rules, rate-limit defaults, concurrency caps.

API keys/secrets vault references (never display raw secrets).

Delete organization data (hard delete with delayed window).

Workflows (no-code flows)
WF-01: Create Target

Input: form → validate URL/IP/repo; store TargetApp; write AuditLog.

WF-02: Run Scan (Orchestration)

Validate role + consent; block if not met.

Snapshot scope & policy → ScanJob.

For each selected tool (in parallel with max concurrency N):

Build tool-specific config (respect Safe Mode: passive only, rate limits).

Call external scanner API via HTTP action.

Poll status; stream sanitized logs to UI.

On completion, fetch results (JSON/SARIF), store Evidence blobs.

Transform results into Finding records (normalize severity, add OWASP tags).

Compute job summary; update TargetApp.last_scan_at; write AuditLog.

If thresholds exceeded and job initiated by CI, set ci_status = failed and post back to webhook.

WF-03: CI Trigger (Webhook Inbound)

Verify HMAC; parse payload (repo, branch, PR).

Resolve to TargetApp and a Policy (e.g., “PR Quick Scan”).

Enqueue WF-02; on completion, post status & summary to PR (checks API).

WF-04: Scheduled Scans (Cron)

For each policy with schedule, enqueue WF-02 respecting concurrency caps.

WF-05: Ticket Sync

On Finding status change to “open/high+”, create/update ticket in selected tracker with link back.

WF-06: Verify Fix

Developer requests rescan of specific finding’s location.

Run minimal scan focusing the path/file/endpoint; if no longer detected across 2 runs, mark “fixed” with timestamp.

External Scanner API Adapters (safe examples)

Implement as modular HTTP calls. Do not embed exploit payloads. Use safe/passive defaults.

OWASP ZAP (DAST)

Start scan: POST /zap/start with { target_url, passiveOnly: true, rateLimit: max_req_per_min, includePaths, excludePaths, authProfileRef }

Poll: GET /zap/status?id=...

Results: GET /zap/report?format=json

Semgrep CI API (Static/Lint)

POST /semgrep/runs with repo ref and ruleset (use “default-ci”).

Fetch SARIF: GET /semgrep/runs/{id}/sarif

OSV.dev / Snyk / Dependabot (SCA)

Submit manifest or repo ref; pull back dependency vulns in JSON.

Gitleaks (Secrets)

Accept uploaded JSON output; or call a managed scanner endpoint; always redact secrets in UI.

(Note: If the platform can’t run scanners itself, this app can delegate to your own “Scanner Worker” service that wraps these APIs.)

Severity & Risk Scoring

Normalize scanner severities to CVSS v3.1 scores.

Display both the original tool severity and normalized CVSS.

Risk = max(CVSS, BusinessImpactModifier[target.risk_tier]).

Default threshold to fail CI: any High or Critical.

OWASP Top 10 Mapping (add tags automatically where applicable)

A01: Broken Access Control

A02: Cryptographic Failures

A03: Injection

A04: Insecure Design

A05: Security Misconfiguration

A06: Vulnerable & Outdated Components

A07: Identification & Authentication Failures

A08: Software & Data Integrity Failures

A09: Security Logging & Monitoring Failures

A10: Server-Side Request Forgery

Consent & Safety Gates (enforce)

Required checkboxes:

“I am authorized to test the specified targets.”

“Testing is limited to declared scope; I accept responsibility.”

Aggressive Mode requires Admin approval + typed confirmation: APPROVE-AGGRESSIVE.

Rate limits applied per tool and per org.

Stop Button on running scans; sends cancel to tools and marks job as cancelled.

Sample Remediation Guidance (generic, non-exploit)

Injection → Use parameterized queries/ORM, input validation, output encoding.

Auth issues → Enforce MFA, use secure session management, rotate secrets.

Crypto failures → Enforce TLS 1.2+, HSTS, modern cipher suites; avoid hard-coded keys.

Outdated components → Pin versions, apply patches, set up dependabot/SBOM review.

Secrets exposure → Rotate exposed secrets immediately; implement pre-commit secret scanning.

Non-Functional Requirements

Security: TLS everywhere, encrypted storage for evidence, SSO (OIDC/SAML), MFA.

Privacy: Redact tokens, cookies, API keys in logs and evidence.

Reliability: Jobs resilient to scanner timeouts; automatic retries with backoff.

Performance: Concurrency limit per org; backpressure when tools slow down.

Observability: Structured logs, metrics: scan duration, findings per scan, false-positive ratio.

Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA.

Example UI Copy / Text

Run Scan modal warning for Aggressive Mode:

“Aggressive Mode may increase load and trigger WAF alerts. Use only on staging or with explicit approval. Continue?”

Example Test Data (seed)

Org: “Acme Corp”

Targets:

acme-web (web) → https://staging.acme.com

acme-api (api) → https://api.staging.acme.com (OpenAPI at /v3/openapi.yaml)

acme-repo (repo) → github.com/acme/inc-webapp

Policies:

Safe Default (Safe, passiveOnly=true, max 120 req/min)

PR Quick Scan (Safe, spider_depth=1, thresholds: fail_on High)

Users: alice@acme (admin), bob@acme (seceng), dev@acme (dev), audit@acme (auditor)

Acceptance Criteria

Users cannot start scans without checking consent boxes and defining scope.

Safe Mode scans complete and return normalized findings visible in the Findings page.

CI webhook can trigger a scan and receive a pass/fail status based on thresholds.

Aggressive Mode requires Admin approval and double confirmation.

Reports export to PDF/CSV with OWASP mappings and CVSS scores.

All actions are written to AuditLog with timestamps and actor IDs.

Secrets/PII do not appear in logs or UI (verified by test).

Optional Bonuses

OpenAPI-aware DAST: ingest an API spec to seed endpoints.

SBOM ingestion: accept CycloneDX/SPDX files and match to OSV.

Risk Exceptions: time-boxed “accept risk” with auto-reopen on expiry.

WAF/CDN Integration: pause aggressive scans if error rates spike.

Service Ownership: sync owners from code-owners, Slack groups, or repo teams.

Builder Instructions (meta)

Use the platform’s HTTP/REST actions for all scanner calls.

Use background jobs/queues for ScanJob orchestration.

Use built-in Auth for RBAC; gate actions by role.

Add Secrets Manager entries for API tokens and never display plaintext keys.

Implement schema-validated JSON transforms for each tool’s output into the Finding model.

Where code is required, keep it to light glue (parsing JSON, mapping severities) — no exploit logic.
